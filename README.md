# Machine-Learning in Petroleum Engineering
 
### Application of Machine Learning in petroleum engineering for predicting future performance, to help minimize the time and computational cost, in order to achieve History-Matched numerical models.

### Data Driven analysis helps find the optimum variables instead of matching model that is highly uncertain and takes time to give results.

### accuracy in ML models is very high and more accurate than simulation models data, beacause of Upscaling and other procedures that lead to un-representative numerical models.

#### The project is in progress for 2022 year, If you are interested and want to contribute, please contact me on email: a.saoud2000@gmail.com
