# Machine-Learning
 
## Application of Machine Learning in petroleum engineering for predicting future performance, to help minimize the time and computational cost, in order to achieve History-Matched results in Reservoir Simulation studies with less cost & time.

## Data Driven analysis helps in focusing on finding the optimum variables instead of matching model that which is highly uncertain.

## accuracy in ML models is very high and more accurate that simulation models data, beacause of Upscaling and other procedures that leads to unrepresentative numerical models.

## The project is in progress for 2022 year, If you are interested and want to contribute, please contact me on email: a.saoud2000@gmail.com
